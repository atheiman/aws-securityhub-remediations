# Automate audit preparation in AWS and integrate across the Three Lines Model - Build a custom integration of AWS Audit Manager with AWS Security Hub

Creates a custom AWS Audit Manager framework that is comprised of custom AWS Audit Manager control sets. The custom Audit Manager control set contains custom AWS Audit Manager controls related to AWS Security Hub findings that span across AWS Security Hub FSBP, CIS and PCI compliance checks. So, instead of the control set being specific to an individual AWS Security Hub compliance check (FSBP,CIS or PCI), the control set spans across Security Hub compliance checks and is specific to a security related domain â€“ for e.g. Identity Management or Network Monitoring.

## How To Install

**Prerequisites**

1. Ensure that AWS Security Hub and AWS Audit Manager are enabled in your account.

2. Create an Amazon S3 bucket with the following name: s3-customauditmanagerframework-AccountId-Region where the AccountId is your AWS Account ID and Region is the AWS Region where you have deployed this template. In this bucket, create a folder named CustomAuditManagerFramework_Lambda and upload the CustomAuditManagerFramework_Lambda.zip (it's in the lambda folder) file there.	

3. Audit Manager works with the Boto3 1.7 libraries. AWS Lambda doesn't ship with Boto3 1.7 by default. This implementation provides that version of Boto3 as a Lambda Layer. Upload the auditmanagerlayer.zip (it's in the layer folder) to the root folder of the S3 bucket created in step 2. 

3. Create an Amazon S3 bucket with the following name: s3-auditmanager-AccountId-Region where the AccountId is your AWS Account ID and Region is the AWS Region where you have deployed this template. In this bucket, create a folder (for e.g. 'evidences). This is the Amazon S3 bucket and folder in which AWS Audit Manager will save your assessment reports. 

4. Create an IAM user/role with Audit owner permissions. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies


**Setup** 

The solution automates the initial setup and deployment in two steps:

1.	Launch the **aws-auditmanager-securityhub.yml** template. For parameters - 1) Provide the name of the S3 bucket and folder (from step 2 in the prerequisites) that contains the source CustomAuditManagerFramework_Lambda.zip 

2. Launch the **aws-auditmanager-customassessment.yml** template. Provide the name of the S3 bucket and folder (from step 3 in the prerequisites) that is the assessment destination as a parameter and 2) Provide the ARN of the Audit owner IAM user/role
